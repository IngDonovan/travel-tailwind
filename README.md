# Travel-Tailwind-Vite-React

Welcome to the repository of my Travel Page project developed using Vite.js and React! In this project, I've created an interactive web application that allows users to explore exciting travel destinations and obtain detailed information about each one. The combination of Vite.js and React has enabled a fast and efficient development experience while delivering exceptional client-side performance.

## Technologies Used

- ViteJS
- React
- CSS3 (with TailWindCss)
- JavaScript
- Responsive Design

## Installation and Usage
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IngDonovan/travel-tailwind.git
```
1. Use the cd command again to enter the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd space-track
```
2. Install Dependencies: Vite.js uses Node.js for development, so you need to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command:
```bash
npm install 
```
or
```bash
npm i 
```
Alternatively, if you prefer to use Yarn:
```bash
yarn
```
3. Run the Project: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using Vite's development command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, and you can access your project in the browser at the indicated address (usually http://localhost:5173).
